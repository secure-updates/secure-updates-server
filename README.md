## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do API keys enhance security?

API keys ensure that only authorized clients can access and retrieve plugin updates from the Secure Updates Server. Each client must present a valid API key in their requests, preventing unauthorized access and enhancing the overall security of the update process.

### Can I manage multiple versions of a plugin?

Yes, Secure Updates Server supports versioning for both mirrored and uploaded plugins. You can upload multiple versions of a plugin, allowing you to rollback to previous versions if needed, ensuring stability across client sites.

### How does Media Library integration work with cloud storage?

Secure Updates Server stores all mirrored and uploaded plugins within the WordPress Media Library. By integrating with cloud offloading plugins like [Offload Media â€“ Cloud Storage](https://wordpress.org/plugins/offload-media-cloud-storage/), these files can be automatically offloaded to cloud storage services such as Amazon S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, or Google Cloud Storage, optimizing server storage and enhancing scalability.

### What should my custom host support?

Your custom host (Secure Updates Server) should have the Secure Updates Server plugin installed and properly configured. It should support REST API endpoints for handling plugin downloads, information retrieval, file verification, and plugin list management. Ensure that API keys are securely managed and that the server is accessible to client sites.

### How do I obtain an API key for the custom host?

API keys are managed through the `API Keys` section in the Secure Updates Server admin interface. As an administrator, you can generate new API keys and distribute them to authorized client sites. Each client site must use its unique API key to authenticate requests to the server.

### Can I use Secure Updates Server with existing cloud offloading plugins?

Absolutely! Secure Updates Server integrates seamlessly with the WordPress Media Library, making it compatible with any media offloading plugin. Ensure that your chosen cloud offloading plugin is properly configured to handle Media Library files, allowing automatic offloading of plugin ZIP files to your preferred cloud storage service.
